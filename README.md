CustomGWAS is a comprehensive, interactive, and user-friendly Jupyter Notebook for conducting a complete Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). It transforms the traditionally complex, multi-tool "black-box" process of GWAS into a single, transparent "white-box" environment.

This pipeline is designed to democratize GWAS, enabling researchers of all computational skill levels to perform a robust, publication-quality analysisâ€”from raw data to final plotsâ€”with confidence and clarity.

##  Key Features

* âœ… **End-to-End Workflow**: A single notebook manages all steps: data loading, quality control, association testing, and visualization.
* ðŸ§  **Automated Data Handling**: Intelligently handles both CSV and PLINK formats. Automatically converts large CSV files to the memory-efficient PLINK binary format to prevent crashes and optimize performance.
* ðŸ“Š **Interactive Quality Control (QC)**: Implements a rigorous QC pipeline with interactive widgets that provide detailed reports on sample and SNP dropout at each step.
* ðŸ“ˆ **Enhanced Phenotype Analysis**: Includes checks for phenotype distribution, automated data transformation for skewed data, and outlier removal to ensure robust results.
* ðŸš€ **Multi-Model Framework**: Runs up to four different association models in parallel to provide a comprehensive view of the results:
    * **Naive GLM**: A basic model for baseline comparison.
    * **PCA-Corrected GLM**: Corrects for population stratification.
    * **Linear Mixed Model (LMM)**: The industry standard, correcting for both population structure and cryptic relatedness.
    * **Leave-One-Chromosome-Out (LOCO) LMM**: The gold standard, avoiding proximal contamination for more accurate results.
* ðŸŽ¨ **Publication-Ready Visuals**: Automatically generates high-quality Manhattan plots and QQ plots for each model.
